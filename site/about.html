  <h1>About Speech.is</h1>
  <p>Speech.is (pronounced "speech dot is") like a mini-web browser, one that lets you visit <code>example.bit</code> addresses using the <code>example.spx.is</code> URL.  For increased privacy, you can also use the hash format: <code>example.bit</code> -> <code>speech.is#example</code>. Speech.is does not host content and all routing information is sourced from your social network by software running in your web browser. Our servers will <b>never</b> touch your social networking profile nor your browsing habits</p>

  <h1>Ending Internet Censorship</h1>
  <p><i>Please note that the following was written for a non-technical audience.  For a more detailed overview see the <a href="#technical">technical section below.</a></i></p>
  <p>Online free speech rights are under attack.  Even in the United States laws such as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca">DMCA</a>, bills such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill">SOPA and PIPA</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/tpp-leak-confirms-worst-us-negotiators-still-trying-trade-away-internet-freedoms">international treaties</a> are steadily eroding online expression of free speech.  Speech.is makes it legally, technologically, and politically difficult to carry out such attacks.  In western-style democratic nations, and especially in the US, we believe that Speech.is will put an end to such efforts.  For nations with existing blacklists, Speech.is serves to illustrate how near-term innovations in decentralized networking will make such efforts ultimately futile.</p>
</section>

<section class="row" id="how">
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>The internet uses something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><i>Domain Name System</i></a>, or DNS, to keep track of websites.  DNS is essentially an online telephone book which pairs website names with their internet number, known as an <i>IP address</i>. Politicians blacklist websites in the DNS phonebook, making it difficult for people to contact these websites.</p>
  <p>Speech.is empowers individuals to use alternative DNS phonebooks.  Normally this requires altering low-level network settings in the operating system.  However, Speech.is acts like a web browser <i>within</i> the web browser but instead of using the operating system's DNS it uses your social network to find secure and compatible phonebooks.  By relying on private communications between friends the mini-browser side steps national internet blacklists.</p>

  <h3 id="bit"><code>.bit</code> domain names</h3>
  <p>The web is broken up into top level domains (TLDs) such as <code>.com</code> and <code>.net</code>.  There are also regional TLDs such as the United Kingdom's <code>.uk</code> and China's <code>.cn</code>.  The <code>.bit</code> TLD is for the internet itself and it is maintained by internet users, like you. The DNS phonebook for <code>.bit</code> sites is stored in a decentralized phonebook which is distributed across all users.</p>
  <p>Regional TLDs have what's known as <i>Second Level Domains</i> such as .co.uk or .gov.br.  Speech.is simply hosts software which, after loading the Speech.is mini-browser examines the URL and translates <code>.bit</code> domains into <code>.spx.is</code> domains.  In the future, we hope that browsers will be capable of using this censorship resistant domain name systems and Speech.is will become obsolete.</p>
  <h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
  <p><i>Note that Speech.is in early-stage development and not yet ready for use by websites with high-security needs.</i></p>
  <p>Speech.is and websites on the <code>spx.is</code> domain benefit from having all of the existing safety features of the browser. Security programs produced by Norton, McAfee, or Kasperky should continue to work without any major changes.</p>
 <p>Integrity of the <code>.bit</code> phonebook is maintained by a democratic majority of users deciding which website names are controlled by what people.  It's a bit more complicated than just a majority vote, it relies on cutting edge data structures to ensure security and fairness of the individual website owners.  But the most important point is that it is democratic: it is controlled by the users of the internet themselves</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/google-nsa_n_4227596.html">No security system is perfect</a>, but it is our sincere belief that Speech.is version 1.0 will be capable of offering levels of protection similar to that of your local ISP, traditional DNS servers, or a financial institution.</p>

    <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
    <p>For a more in-depth technical overview of how Speech.is operates, please reference the .bit <a href="http://dot-bit.org/JsDNS_RFC">jsDNS RFC.</a></p>
    <p>The short version:  <a href="https://github.com/SpeechJS/speech.js/tree/master">Speech.js</a> uses an overlay network (eventually a DHT with fallback to a F2F/social network) to get DNS information from the Namecoin blockchain and load it in an iFrame.  Speech.is#wikipedia enforces the correct <b>legal and political framing</b> for thinking about the network.</p>
    <p>The long version: Speech.is simply a static HTML page that is blindly served up to any who visits any non '*.www' cname of speech.is ir spx.is domains.  The page embeds <a href="https://github.com/SpeechJS/speech.js/tree/master">Speech.js</a>, a script which examines the URL and then queries local-storage for any matching records.  If none are found, the website checks if there are any existing publishing sources and checks them.  At the moment, we are providing a REST style lookup based on an XML-RPC interface to a Namecoin client but we envision having a plethora of backend adapters.  The first up will be a simple raw.github.com adapter, with more sophisticated adapters to follow for popular social networks and (eventually) a DHT using WebRTC.</p>
    <p>Any self-respecting geek would have rolled their eyes and pointed (correctly) out that the speech.is domain and the IP addresses of the .bit websites can be blocked.  While we can't stop DNS level censorship (it's just too easy) we can do four things:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>Make it <em>politically</em> difficult to censor websites.  DNS blacklists do not block kids from porn (as any horny teenager can attest) nor do they slow distribution of such materials: blacklists are political theater.  Speech.is injects a soundbite into the mouths of politicians which brings the minds of the listeners back to the real threat: the loss of our free speech rights online.</li>
         <li>Enable websites to provide per user URL endpoints which (when combined with the <code>speech.is#domain</code> syntax) forces would-be censorship boards to block the entire spx.is slTLD.  <i>Overzealous blocking would actually be a good thing:</i> it makes it easier to convince the relevant technical committees that something needs to be done.</li>
         <li>Make <code>.bit</code> and other altDNS systems interoperable with domains on the ICANN root.  Prior attempts at proxies, mirrors, and DNS suffixes all suffered from large hosting expenses and the legal nightmare that is the DMCA.  Hosting a single static HTML page is very, very scalable and because we neither host nor link to any website other than social media sites, <a href="legal">we should be in the clear legally</a>.</li>
         <li>Illustrate how <b>utterly</b> pointless these laws are: WebRTC, modern Javascript, and client-side storage turn the browser and any website it visits into a Turing complete system capable of autonomous communication.  With gigabit internet speeds coming down the pike, we will be able to build an overlay network that will abstract away any censorship regime they can come up with.</li>
       </ol>

  <h2>Legal Rational</h2>
  <p>This legal rationale assumes free speech laws of a western democracy, a safe bet given the downfall of SOPA and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law">Hadopi</a>. I am not a lawyer but my review of the relevant caselaw and the logic used is rather simple.  The weird laws we have are primarily a result of how technologically inept the legislators and judges were in the early 2000’s. It is similar to when the Alabama legislative attempt to define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill">Pi as being equal to 3.2</a>.  As information transforms from books, newspapers, and posters to mass-less point particles, legislative attempts to make a distinction between speech and information become as meaningless as their attempt to square the circle.</p>
  <p>The courts, to a degree, acknowledge that the distinction is perceptual. The legal rational separating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Studios,_Inc._v._Grokster,_Ltd.">Grokster</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay_trial">TPB</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(company)">BitTorrent inc.</a> and Mozilla is not <i>technological</i> but <i>motivational</i>,</p>

  <blockquote>&#34;We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.&#34; -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Studios,_Inc._v._Grokster,_Ltd.">SCOTUS</a></blockquote>

  <p>The legal difference between Mozilla’s browser and Google’s search engine is that Google <i>stores data</i> while Mozilla just produces the software needed to get the user to the website. The jsDNS specification upon which Speech.js is modeled strictly follows the law in this regard and Speech.is in particular has significant non-infringing uses. By relying on a F2F network and the hashtag routing syntax, Speech.is incapable of listening in on the private communications between individuals.</p>

  <p>I may not be a lawyer, but I do <a href="http://www.cognitivepolicyworks.com/about-us/">understand how mental models work</a> and laws are nothing but codified social norms.  In the past, these larger free speech issues were "fought" over cases which made piracy, not free speech, the central figure. The courts smelled something funny and rationalized their way to a legal opinion.  Speech.is and F2F networks enable us to play by their rules <i>and win</i>.
